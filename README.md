### Java File Handling Utility

This Java program demonstrates basic file handling operations, including reading, writing, and modifying text files. It serves as a utility to interact with files through standard input/output operations in Java.

### Features
- **Read from a file**: The program reads the contents of a specified text file and displays it on the console.
- **Write to a file**: It allows the user to create and write content into a new file or overwrite an existing one.
- **Modify a file**: The program enables modifying an existing file by appending new text or replacing parts of the file content.

### How It Works
1. **Reading a File**: The program opens a file in read mode using `FileReader` and `BufferedReader`, displaying its contents line by line.
2. **Writing to a File**: It creates or overwrites a file using `FileWriter` and `BufferedWriter`, allowing the user to input new data to be written to the file.
3. **Modifying a File**: The program provides the functionality to modify the content by either appending new text to the file or replacing specific lines or words.

### Instructions for Usage
1. **Clone the repository**: Download the code to your local system using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-handling-utility.git
   ```

2. **Compile the Program**: Use the Java compiler to compile the `FileHandlingUtility.java` class:
   ```
   javac FileHandlingUtility.java
   ```

3. **Run the Program**: Execute the program using the following command:
   ```
   java FileHandlingUtility
   ```

4. **Choose Operation**: The program will present you with a menu to select whether you want to read, write, or modify a file. Provide the appropriate file path and content as prompted.

### Example Usage
1. To read a file:
   ```
   Enter the file path: example.txt
   ```

2. To write to a file:
   ```
   Enter the content to write: Hello, World!
   ```

3. To modify a file:
   ```
   Enter the line number to replace: 2
   Enter new content: Updated content
   ```

This utility demonstrates essential file handling operations in Java, including reading, writing, and modifying text files.
